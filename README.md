# wps-process-inter-txt

Wrapper process for the [quakeledger](https://github.com/GFZ-Centre-for-Early-Warning/quakeledger) python script to integrate it into the [52North WPS Server](https://github.com/52North/WPS).

It follows the same way as [wps-process-inter-txt](https://github.com/riesgos/wps-process-inter-txt) to wrap a python file.
